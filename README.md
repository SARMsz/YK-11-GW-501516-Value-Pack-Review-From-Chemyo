<h1>Chemyo YK‑11 & GW501516 Value Pack Review: My Personal Experience</h1>

<p>I’ve been using research chemicals for years, testing top brands like Swisschems on purity, potency, price, and shipping speed. Recently, I tried the Chemyo YK‑11 &amp; GW501516 Value Pack and was pleasantly surprised. Over an 8‑week cycle, I tracked lean muscle gains, strength, and endurance. Here’s my honest, no‑fluff review from start to finish.</p>

<h2>What Are YK‑11 and GW501516?</h2>
<p><strong>YK‑11</strong> is a myostatin inhibitor SARM. It blocks myostatin to allow faster muscle growth and cell differentiation. <strong>GW501516</strong> (Cardarine) is a PPARδ agonist research compound that boosts fat oxidation, endurance, and recovery. Together, they aim to maximize lean mass, vascularity, and stamina without injections or harsh side effects.</p>

<p>After understanding how these compounds work, I decided to order the Chemyo pack. <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/yk-11-and-gw501516-value-pack/?campaign=github&amp;ref=166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy the YK‑11 &amp; GW501516 Value Pack at Chemyo</a> and start your cycle today!</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>I use the same 10‑point system I’ve applied to Swisschems products:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purity</strong> (third‑party HPLC reports)</li>
  <li><strong>Price per mg</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Shipping speed</strong> (Europe/Vilnius baseline)</li>
  <li><strong>Customer feedback</strong> from forums and direct messages</li>
  <li><strong>Packaging</strong> and labelling clarity</li>
</ul>
<p>On each metric, Chemyo scored between 4.5 and 5 stars. Their HPLC purity certificates matched or exceeded Swisschems, pricing was competitive, and I received my order in 6 days to Vilnius.</p>

<h2>My 8‑Week Cycle Protocol</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Weeks 1–8:</strong> YK‑11 at 10 mg/day (split dose)</li>
  <li><strong>Weeks 1–8:</strong> GW501516 at 15 mg/day (morning with food)</li>
  <li><strong>Diet:</strong> High‑protein (2 g/kg), clean carbs, moderate fats</li>
  <li><strong>Training:</strong> 4 days strength, 2 days HIIT cardio</li>
</ul>
<p>I logged workouts, body measurements with calipers, and a simple cardio test (800 m run time) weekly. I also noted sleep quality and appetite changes.</p>

<h2>Results: Gains, Strength, and Endurance</h2>
<p><strong>Lean Muscle Mass:</strong> I gained 6 lbs of lean mass by week 8. Caliper readings showed a drop in overall body fat from 18% to 14%.</p>
<p><strong>Strength Improvements:</strong> My 1RM bench press went from 185 lbs to 205 lbs. Squat improved from 225 lbs to 250 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Endurance Boost:</strong> My 800 m run time improved from 3:10 to 2:50. I felt less lactic acid burn during HIIT.</p>
<p><strong>Recovery:</strong> Morning soreness was minimal. I slept better and felt more vascular in arms and shoulders.</p>
<p>Customer reviews echo similar gains and endurance boosts with minimal side effects. Chemyo’s batch consistency stood out compared to past Swisschems orders.</p>

<h2>Pricing, Shipping, and Purity</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> €0.85 per mg YK‑11, €0.75 per mg GW501516</li>
  <li><strong>Shipping:</strong> 6 days to Europe, discreet packaging</li>
  <li><strong>Purity:</strong> 99%+ HPLC validated</li>
</ul>
<p>The value pack saves about 15% versus buying each separately. Given the results, it’s a solid deal.</p>

<p>A: Only for experienced users. Better once you’ve tried basic SARMs.</p>
